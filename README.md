EzDB
====

EzDB is a easy to use mysql helper for PHP.

Philosophy behind this project is clear: let developers focus on where they add values.

In most project:
 - 90% of MySQL query are simple and boring query like SELECT * FROM table WHERE primary_key = 42.
 - The rest are more advance query with JOIN, ORDER, GROUP BY and other stuff like this

EzDB allow you to do 90% of query with a simple and easy to use PHP API and let you use regular SQL for the rest.

It is build with performance in mind and is already used in many heavy load services.

Why ?
-------

 - SQL is not a bad language and should not be avoid at all cost.
 - Developpers are lazy and write simple query is annoying.

Requirement :
-------

 - EzDB need APC
 - You should configure primary key in your mysql table to enable object magic methods.

Basic Usage :
-------

```php
// connect
$db = new EzDB(DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, DB_HOST, DB_PORT);

// fetch
$car = $db->get->car(42); // get car with primary key 42

// update
$car->model = "My Model";
$car->save() ;

// duplicate
$new_car = $car->duplicate() ;

// delete
$new_car->delete() ; 

// create
$datas = array('model' => 'Famous Model') ;
$famous_car = $db->create->car($datas) ;

// query with a join works, you get sub objects for each JOIN
$sql = 'SELECT * FROM car
LEFT JOIN brand ON brand.id = car.brand_id';
$cars = $db->query->car($sql) ;

// iterate
foreach ($cars as $my_car)
{
	print "<h4>{$my_car->model} â€“ {$my_car->brand->name}</h4>";
}

// auto get column from another table (using foreign key)
$brand = $car->getBrand() ;
$cars_for_this_brand = $brand->listCar();

// manual query
$db->query("UPDATE car SET model = CONCAT('The ', model) WHERE 1");

// multi query
$db->MultiQuery("UPDATE car SET model = CONCAT('Das ', model) WHERE 1; UPDATE car SET model = CONCAT('Le ', model) WHERE 1");
```

Custom class
-------

By default object class returned by EzDB command are EzDBObj. If you need to use custom class, classname must be EZDB followed by name of the table, and class must extend EzDBObj:

```php

class EzDBCar extend EzDBObj
{

  // this method will be called when object is instanciate
  function EZdbInit()
  {

  }

  function print()
  {
    echo $this->model.' - '.$this->getBrand()->name;
  }

}

$car = $db->get->car(42);

$car->print();
```

Advanced Query
-------

Some SQL query return a result that have no link with any table, in this case magic method (delete(), duplicate(), ...) will not be available.

```php

$car_count = $db->ObjectFromSql("SELECT COUNT(*) AS ct FROM car");

print $car_count->ct;

$cars_names = $db->listFromSql("SELECT title FROM brand WHERE title LIKE 'p%' ORDER BY title");

foreach ($cars_names as $car_name)
{
  print $car_name->title;
}
```

Cache
-------

EzDB can cache mysql result for you. To do that, you need to register which tables can be cached and for how long.

```php
// enable cache for table brand 
$db->AddCachedTable('brand', 3600 /* 3600 secondes cache, default is 300 */);

// disable cache for table car 
$db->DeleteCachedTable('car');
```

As EzDB only connect to mysql server when needed, if you cache the right table you can easily create pages that can render without connecting to mysql. This is especially interesting for a front page.

Master/Slave MySQL Server
-------

EzDB support Master/Slave MySQL configuration. You can setup a slave mysql configuration that is READ ONLY. EzDB will connect to the right server automatically.

```php
$db->setReadOnlyConfiguration(DB_USER_READ_ONLY, DB_PASSWORD_READ_ONLY, DB_NAME_READ_ONLY, DB_HOST_READ_ONLY, DB_PORT_READ_ONLY);

// this will connect to read server
$car = $db->get->car(42);

$car->model = "Model 42";

// this will switch mysql server to to read/write server (default server)
$car->save();

// if you get another car, connection will remain on read/write server
$car = $db->get->car(21);

```

Debug and Query Log
-------

When you develope your service, it can be annoying to suffer from deprecated cache (like if you change your database scheme and ezdb still not aware of it).
To avoid this you can:
 - Disable cache completely
```php
$db->no_cache = true;
```
 - Adjust default TTL to a lower value (300 seconds by default)
```php
$db->default_cache_ttl = 60;
```

To check what is hapening between ezdb and your mysql server, you can also enable query log:
```php
$db->enable_query_log = true;
$db->query_log_path = '/var/log/ezdb';
```

All SQL query will be print on screen and stored on disk.

Class Loader
-------

You can tell ezdb where you store your custom EzDB class:
```php
$db->autoload_class_path = '/var/www/project/class';
```
Class loader work this way:
 - PHP filename must be name of table.
 - If in table name, there is a underscore ( _ ), it will optionally cut this to check sub directories.
 - If file found it is require once and if a class with according name: EzDB + table name exist, it will be used as EzDB custom class.

Meta data
-------

You can add meta data via table row comment, this meta data help EzDB do some automatic data treatment:

 - compress=1: EzDB will compress and decompress data on the fly
 - type=json: EzDB will json encode/decode data on the fly
 - type=json_array: EzDB will json encode/decode as an array data on the fly

Other options
-------
 - When listing a table, you can ask EzDB to use primary key value a key index for php array:
```php
$db->fill_list_with_primary_key = true;
```
 - EzDB can automaticelly set SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS in each SQL query so that you can findout how much entry are found in your query:
```php
$db->auto_get_found_rows = true;
$total = $db->GetAffectedRows();
```
- to change default cache TTL, 300 seconds by default:
```php
$db->default_cache_ttl = 300;
```
